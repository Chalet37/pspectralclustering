Parallel Spectral Clustering must be run in linux environment with mpich2-1.2.

= Installation = 

  * Parallel Infrastructure is based on MPI. Firstly mpich2 must be installed before running. You can download it from http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/.
    * Install mpich2
      * Download mpich2-1.2.tar.gz
      * Extract it to a path
      * `./configure`
      * `make`
      * `sudo make install`
      * After installing, you will find some binaries and scripts in $PATH. Test by running `mpd` to see if it exists
    * Create password file `~/.mpd.conf` with access mode 600 (rw-------) in home directory. The file should contain a single line `MPD_SECRETWORD=PASSWORD`. Because you may have many  machines, you must do this on each machine.
      * `touch ~/.mpd.conf`
      * `chmod 600 ~/.mpd.conf`
      * `echo "MPD_SECRETWORD=anypassword" > ~/.mpd.conf`
    * Pick one machine as the master and startup mpd(mpi daemon)
      * `mpd --daemon --listenport=55555`
    * Other machines act as slave and must connect to the master
      * `mpd --daemon -h serverHostName -p 55555`
    * Check whether the environment is setup successfully: on master, run `mpdtrace`, you will see all the slaves. If no machines show up, you must check your mpi setup and refer to mpich2 user manual.
  * Download Parallel Spectral Clustering package and extract and run `make` in its directory. You will see four binaries generated `compute_distance`/`distance_to_similarity`/`evd`/`kmeans`. We use mpich2 builtin compiler mpicxx to compile, it is a wrap of g++.
